nobots
======

a fun portfolio Angular app by Blake Turner

##Purpose

This App is by no means a real-life business (though I would much prefer a NoBot to a Captcha), it is merely to demonstrate my ability to develop applications using AngularJS.

##About the App

I used a few great technologies to get this up and running:

-Bootstrap
-Bootflat
-Yeoman
-Bower
-Google Fonts
-Many other plugins and recipes found across the web

This app is totally static, with a fake API pulling from json files. It uses LocalStorage to simulate true persistence.
