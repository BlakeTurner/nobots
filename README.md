nobots
======

a fun portfolio Angular app by Blake Turner

##Purpose

This App is by no means a real-life business (though I would much prefer a NoBot to a Captcha), it is merely to demonstrate my ability to develop applications using AngularJS.

The app itself is fully responsive, but I feel the best user experience is either on tablet or desktop.

##About the App

I used a few great technologies to get this up and running:

- Bootstrap
- Bootflat
- Yeoman
- Bower
- Google Fonts
- Many other plugins and recipes found across the web

This app is totally static, with a fake API pulling from json files. It uses LocalStorage to simulate true persistence.

##This is as public as it gets!

Feel free to happily plagiarize any of this code. It was all learned from books, videos, tutorials and a good amount of head scratching, so I'm happy to share.
